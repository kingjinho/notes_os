- OS in everywhere
  - SmartPhone, TV, PC, Laptop, Watch

- Necessity of OS
  - `In early days, computer did not require any rules` because computer during those days `only performed designated
  computation`
  - As computer and its components grow and `perform additional complex things, computer start to need sets of rules to
  manage itself, and this is where OS comes into play`
      - Consider the world without laws, it must be chaotic world! :smiling_imp: :smiling_imp: :smiling_imp:
  - `Computer works without OS, but We have to deal with every thing by ourselves`, also
    - Without OS - Impossible to add additional functionalities, only used for initial purpose
    - Example: Simple phone VS SmartPhone
