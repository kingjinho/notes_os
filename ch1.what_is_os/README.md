# Introduction of Operating System

- Operating systems that we know : Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, Android...

- OS in everywhere
  - SmartPhone, TV, PC, Laptop, Watch

- Necessity of OS
  - `In early days, computer did not require any rules` because computer during those days 
    `only performed designated computation`
  - As computer and its components grow and `perform additional complex things, computer start to need sets of rules to
  manage itself, and this is where OS comes into play`
      - Consider the world without laws, it must be chaotic world! :smiling_imp: :smiling_imp: :smiling_imp:
  - `Computer works without OS, but We have to deal with every thing by ourselves`, also
    - Without OS - Impossible to add additional functionalities, only used for initial purpose
    - Example: Simple phone VS SmartPhone

- What is OS
  - `A Software` that resides in Computer or any other machines, manages resources and application programs
  
  - `A Software` that sits in `between Users and a Hardware`, let users `utilize hardware without knowing the details
  of a hardware with self-defined sets of rules`
    
  - `Compiler` When programmers write an application, they use programming language which human can understand.
  Later, with help of Compiler, code is converted into something called `machine code` which computer can
    understand, and computer executes it.
    
  - `Waiter`: Waiter at restaurant takes orders from customers(`Users`) :point_right: takes orders to the kitchen 
    :point_right: chef take orders and start cooking(`Hardware`). Think about customers going into the kitchen 
    and start cooking by themselves :point_right: Nightmare!!
  
  - `Administrator`: If computer only executes one thing, There's no need to have OS. However, Since computer executes
  more than one process(think of it as a program such as word, chrome, `for now`) with limited number 
    of resources(CPU, memory), Computer needs someone to manage this: Operating System.

- Role of Operating System
  - Resource Management
    - We do many things with computer at a time(even at this moment, I am listening music on YouTube, jetbrains is on
       and 10 separate chrome pages are opened) with limited resources.
    - Operating System's role is to `let user use computers seamlessly by allocating resources effectively, efficiently`
  - Secure Resource
    - From `Waiter` example from above, it is going to be such a mess if customers(Process) cook by themselves at a restaurant
    - `By protecting(or hiding) kitchen(resources), it prevents processes from abnormal activities` 
  - Provide Hardware Interface
    - How are we going to use resources, if OS secure resources and manage resources?
    - `By providing hardware interfaces, OS still manages and secure resources, while letting users utilize resources
      in predefined way without knowing details of it` 
    - `Easy to add/remove resources - Plug & Play`  
  - Provide User Interface
    - Graphical User Interface
    - `Let users use OS easily`


  
- Goal of Operating System
  - Resource Management :point_right::point_right: `Efficiency`
  - Securing Resource :point_right::point_right:  `Safety`
  - Providing Hardware Interface  :point_right::point_right: `Expandability`
  - Provide User Interface  :point_right::point_right: `Convenience`
