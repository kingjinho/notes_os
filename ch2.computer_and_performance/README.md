[Components of Computer](#Components-of-Computer)
- CPU, Main memory
- Keyboard, Mouse, Printer, Monitor, Hard-drive ...
- Main memory loses data when power goes off :point_right: need something to store permanently(Hard-drive, USB)
    - Main memory - first storage
    - Hard-drive or USB - second storage


- CPU and Memory
    - Human brain
    - Memory stores program and data, `divided into byte`

- I/O Devices
    - Input: Keyboard, mouse, scanner etc
    - Output: Speaker, Monitor, Printer
    - In the past, CPU calculates graphical calculation, but these days GPU does that

- Storage
    - Primary Storage & Second Storage
    - Primary storage is faster but expensive

- Main Board(motherboard)
    - All these pieces of hardware are installed on motherboard, and connected by `Bus`
    - What is `Bus`?
        - `Is a communication pathway that allows data to travel between different components`

- Von Neumann Architecture

    - Computers these days are made base on von Neumann Architecture
    - Computer before Von Neumann Architecture,
      - Manually hard-wired everything to re-program
    - It basically suggested Basic Structure of Computer,
        1. CPU
        2. Memory
        3. I/O Device
    - `Leave the hardware, switch program by using memory and having program loaded on memory`
    -
